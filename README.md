I'm **Akshin Mustafayev**, a Site Reliability Engineer based in Canada 🇨🇦. I spend my time designing tools that simplify infrastructure operations — usually before coffee kicks in.

I’m also the creator of **[Infrabot](https://infrabot-io.github.io/index.html)**, a Telegram-based infrastructure management service used to control IT systems through chat commands.
